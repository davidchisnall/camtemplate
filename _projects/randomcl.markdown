title: Extend random testing for OpenCL2.0
type: mcd
---

Project proposed by Anastasia Stulova.

[CLSmith](https://github.com/ChrisLidbury/CLSmith) (based on CSmith) is a tool developed at Imperial College for random testing of OpenCL.
It could be extend to test OpenCL 2.0 features or a subset of those. As far as I know there is a way to do it by specifying a grammar. Some papers [describing the tool](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~chenyang/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf) and [how it can be extended](http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/tools/CLsmith/paper.pdf). 

OpenCL 2 support in Clang is relatively immature and so a successful outcome for this project would find and report some bugs.
